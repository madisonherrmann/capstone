## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Scope and Background of Project</span>

- Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) are chronic.

\

- Challenges in Recovery:
  - Lifelong management and continuous monitoring.
  - Limited resources for sustained support post-treatment.
  - Individuals' needs evolve, making long-term recovery management challenging.
  
:::{.notes}
Alcohol and opioid use disorders are chronic conditions that require lifelong management. Recovery is often a long, dynamic, and complex process, with individuals facing numerous challenges:

Effective initial treatment is not enough—sustained support is critical but often lacking.

Recovery needs continuous monitoring because what works at one moment might not work at another.

Individuals’ needs evolve over time, adding complexity to long-term recovery management.

There is an unmet need for accessible and affordable solutions to address these challenges effectively.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Scope and Background of Project</span>

![](nih.png){fig-width=10}
- A part of a larger project under the Addiction Research Center.

- Overarching Goals:

  -   Mitigate barriers in accessibility and affordability
  -   Implement a temporally precise risk-monitoring system
  -   Deliver tailored support and recommendations

:::{.notes}
Our project is part of a larger initiative under the Addiction Research Center at UW-Madison, supported by the NIH.

The broader project aims to address barriers to accessibility and affordability in managing recovery from substance use disorders. It seeks to develop a temporally precise risk-monitoring system that will be integrated into mobile devices, such as smartphone health apps. This system will provide tailored support and recommendations to individuals in recovery.
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Scope and Background of Project</span>

- Our project is to build and to evaluate machine learning models to predict AUD and OUD lapses

  \

  - To predict when a future lapse may happen.

  \

  - To figure out why a lapse is likely to happen.

:::{.notes}
Our specific focus is on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict future lapses in Alcohol Use Disorder and Opioid Use Disorder. Using the machine learning models, we aim to predict when a future lapse may happen, and to figure out why a lapse is likely to happen.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Lapse</span>

- Temporally precise onset

\

- Important target for intervention

\

- **Single lapse** can result in **overdose and death**

\

:::{.notes}
**add image to right**
Before I get any further, it is important to distinguish lapse from relapse. 
- Lapses are clearly defined and have a temporally precise onset.
- They're an important target for intervention and serve as an early warning sign for relapse.
- A single lapse can be detrimental resulting in overdose and death, emphasizing the need for a temporally-precise, risk-monitoring system.

Now lets characterize the OUD sample. Data was collected on 336 individuals. The majority of participants reported severe symptoms of OUD. The participants were in early to mid-stages of recovery, and had received 1 - 12 month medication-assisted treatment. All participants committed to abstinence for the duration of the study.

\

- Label windows roll day-by-day starting at 6am in the participants' time zone.

\

- Take the daily EMA data.

:::{.notes} 
Using daily EMA data, we performed feature engineering to transform raw data into meaningful signals predictive of future opioid lapse. Machine learning models were then developed to predict the likelihood of a lapse occurring on the following day.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Models</span>


- XGBoost algorithm

  - optimized using the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method

\

- 5x10 k-fold CV

\

- CHTC


:::{.notes}
The models were trained using the XGBoost algorithm with a five by ten-fold cross-validation framework to ensure robust performance evaluation. We used XGBoost because it consistently outperformed the other three algorithms during preliminary exploratory analyses, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Elastic Net. Furthermore, the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method, which we planned to use for explanatory analyses of feature importance in our full models, is optimized for XGBoost. Model training utilized high-throughput computing to efficiently explore and identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters.

:::{.notes}
Given the imbalance in our labels, with a large majority of non-lapse cases and a small portion of lapse cases, we used the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (auROC) to evaluate model performance, as it is effective in handling unbalanced data. The right graph shows the auROC values of the best model across the 5 by 10, that is 50 folders. The median auROC is 0.94, which is outstanding. This means there is a 94% chance that the model will score a lapse higher than a no-lapse when it is a lapse instance. The left shows a graph of the roc curve for the best model.

For any given instance, Shapley values show how much each feature pushes the prediction either higher or lower compared to the baseline. On a global level, we can aggregate Shapley values across the dataset to measure the overall importance of each feature. 
For this model, the top 3 features are:
first, past use, which indicates that participants reported using opioids since their last assessment;
second, participants' confidence in future recovery;
third, participants' urge to use the substance.

![](oud_top3_c.png) 

:::{.notes} 
Here are the graphs showing the relationship between feature value and Shapley value for the top 3 features. 

Higher "Past Use" values positively contribute to the model's predictions.

For Confidence, we observe a non-linear contribution to the model's predictions. At lower values, Confidence has a positive impact, pushing the prediction higher. As the values of Confidence increase, its impact diminishes, becoming neutral at moderate values. However, when Confidence reaches higher values, it starts to negatively affect the prediction. 

For Urge, we observe an opposite non-linear trend. At lower values, Urge has a negative impact, pushing the prediction lower. As the values of Urge increase, its impact diminishes, becoming neutral at moderate values. However, when Urge reaches higher values, it starts to positively affect the prediction.

For substance use variables, higher score instimulant use positively influences predictions, while higher score in inhalant use has a more negative effects. Other substances, like alcohol and cannabis, have moderate but consistent contributions.

For emotional states, higher score in anxiety has a strong positive influence on predictions. Other states, such as anger, happiness, and pleasantness, contribute more neutrally, with minimal impact on model outcomes.

Let's look at some other features.

For substance use variables, lower score in stimulant use since last assessment positively contributes predictions, as the score gets higher, the contribution diminishes. Similar trends can be observed for inhalant use and sedative use. Other substances, like alcohol and cannabis, have neutral but consistent contributions.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Model Implementation</span>


- How might we use these models to deploy the **right** recommendation, to the **right person**, at the **right time**? 

\

- Retrain model with [geolocation]{style="color: blue;"} and [EMA]{style="color: blue;"}
  - Passive sensing
  - Continuous monitoring
  

:::{.notes}
Now that we have a model that can successfully predict lapse probability, How might we implement it to deploy the right recommendation, to the right person, at the right time? Through the addition of geolocation features, we can gain insight into not only when an individual is at a higher risk of lapsing, but why. Geolocation is a form of passive sensing that can provide context into the places and situations impacting lapse risk.    
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Geolocation</span>

![](gps3.jpg)

:::{.notes}
 Here is an example of some the survey questions asked regarding geolocation. Participants reported frequently visited locations and were asked various questions regarding previous drinking locations, alcohol availability, valence, and more. Their time spent at these locations was documented using gps monitoring via smartphone. We can begin to understand the need for continuous monitoring in recovery by looking at data from our alcohol use disorder study.

To start, lets characterize our sample. Data was collected on 151 individuals with moderate to severe AUD in the early stages of recovery. The majority of participants reported over 10 symptoms and committed to abstinence for the duration of the study.
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">AUD Characteristics</span>

![](aud_demographics.png)


:::{.notes}
We had reasonable diversity across many characteristics including age, sex at birth, marital status, education, and income. However, given the recruiting methods, there is very little racial and ethnic diversity across participants. Now that we have some background on the sample, we can pivot to the modeling process. 
::: 



## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Area under ROC Curve (auROC)</span>

![](aud_auroc.png) 

:::{.notes}
I retrained the model using 1x daily EMA with geolocation and day level windows. High throughput computing was utilized along with the XGBOOST algorithm and 5 by 10 kfold cross validation. The best configuration resulted in a median auroc of .85. The drop in performance is likely due to using 24-hr periods instead of hour-by-hour windows to predict lapse probability. Despite the drop in performance, additional geolocation improved the models contextual awareness, a key step that brings us closer to deploying a real-time risk monitoring and support system. Lets now look at what features were the most important for the model's predictions.
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Global Importance</span>


![](aud_global_importance.png) 


:::{.notes} 
Past use and future efficacy, both from the EMAs,  were by far the most important predictors of lapse probability across participants. In regards to the geolocation features, risky location was the most important. Others include: alcohol availability at location, type of location, and location valence. Lets look at how what these features mean and how they can predict lapse probability. 
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Important Risk Features</span>

![](aud_past_use.png) 

:::{.notes}
Past use refers to reported drinking days since the participants' last EMA. The feature values on the x-axis reveal how important past use is across participants, classified as low, medium, or high. Drawing your attention to the y-axis, observations below zero are decreasing lapse probability, while observations above zero are increasing it. Observations below zero reflect reports of no past use, or not drinking.  There is a mostly linear relationship with past use and increased lapse risk.
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Important Risk Features</span>

![](aud_future_efficacy.png) 

:::{.notes}
Future efficacy asked participants how likely are you to drink within the next week, on a scale from 1-10? On average, reports of high likelihood were associated with a higher probability of lapsing.
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Important Risk Features</span>

![](aud_risky_location.png) 

:::{.notes}
Risky location is a gps feature that asked participants to rate frequently visited locations that put them at risk for drinking. They classified these locations as low, medium, high, or no risk. Through GPS monitoring, the time spent at these locations was recorded. It is likely that time spent at a high risk location, such as a bar, would increase lapse probability. Whereas, time spent at no risk location, such as an AA meeting, would likely decrease it. However, the plot reveals risky location has a mostly neutral impact on lapse probability, with most places clustered around zero. The absence of a clear trend likely suggests the relationship between risky location and lapse risk varies across participants. Now that we have a sense of how these features can predict lapse risk, let's see how they vary across individuals and time.
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Local Importance</span>

- [Shapley Values]{style="color: blue;"}

  -   Negative values decrease lapse probability.
      -  Can act as **protective features**
  
  \
  
  -   Positive values increase lapse risk probability.
      - Can act as **risk features**

:::{.notes}
SHAPley values are an explanatory approach providing insight into the relative risk factors for an individual. They allows us to determine which features on which days impact lapse risk for each participant. Negative values indicate a decreased risk of lapse, and can act as protective features. While positive values indicate an increased risk of lapse probability, and can act as risk features. Lets look at the most important features for a specific participant across the study.
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Local Importance</span>


![](aud_risk_loc.png)

:::{.notes}
In the beginning, This participant had little change in their risk features, with past use and future efficacy bringing down their probability of lapse. The other features are staying constant at zero, indicating little to no influence on lapse risk. However, around day 35, past use, the blue line, drives up their lapse risk considerably. This increase coincides with the slight increase in time spent at a risky location, as shown with the purple line. Risky location provides insights into why this individual may have lapsed, as they likely visited to a bar. Moreover, future efficacy, the yellow-green line, is shown closely lagging behind past use. This makes sense as a person who is currently using is likely to feel less confident about future abstinence. Around day 50, the future risky situation feature decreases their lapse risk, acting as a protective feature at certain points. This participant likely reported a low likelihood of risky situations in the next week. The variability of this plot highlights that at any given day, the most important feature impacting lapse risk can change.
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Local Importance</span>


![](aud_loc_valence.png)

:::{.notes}
For this participant, past use acts as their most important protective feature across time, differing from the previous example. This is shown by the blue line bringing down their lapse risk, indicating someone who did not lapse on study. The green line increasing their risk of lapse is location valence, or the emotions associated with a particular place. It is likely that time spent at an unpleasant place increased this participant's lapse risk. Around day 75, future efficacy jumped above location valence, likely due to the participant reporting a higher likelihood of drinking, relative to their previous self-reports. Their lack of confidence in future abstinence increases their probability of lapsing. There is a vast difference between this participant's relative risk features and the previous. For this participant, past use acts as their most important protective feature, consistently lowering their risk of lapse. As opposed to the previous plot, where past use acted as the most important risk factor, increasing the probability of lapse. This highlights the need for personalized recommendations and supports as different risk features can impact lapse risk in different ways, at different times, for different people. The ability to use these features to deliver tailored interventions that support recovery is the first step towards clinical implementation. 
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Future Directions</span>


- Writing [recommendations]{style="color: blue;"} based on important features

\

- Measuring [trust]{style="color: blue;"}, [engagement]{style="color: blue;"}, and [usability]{style="color: blue;"} of risk-monitoring system interventions

\

- Determining how models can be [clinically useful]{style="color: blue;"} 


:::{.notes}
Now that we know the most important features impacting lapse probability, we can begin to develop support recommendations for model implementation. Once the system is implemented, it will provide users with tailored recommendations based on their current risk features. Our team is actively exploring the optimal methods for delivering these recommendations, including the language, tone, and format, to minimize participant burden. We are working to develop reliable approaches that measure the system's trust, engagement, and usability. In doing so, we hope to see that engaging with support messages acts as a protective factor for continued recovery.
