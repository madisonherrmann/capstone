- How might we use these models to deploy the right recommendation, at the right time, to the right person?
  - Retrain model with [geolocation]{style="color: blue;"} and [EMA]{style="color: blue;"}
  - Key step towards real-time risk-prediction system
  
\

- Geolocation & 1x daily EMA Model
  - XGBoost algorithm
  - 5x10 k-fold CV
  - Day level windows

:::{.notes}
Now that we can successfully predict lapse probability, How might we use these models to deploy the right recommendation, at the right time, to the right person? Through the addition of geolocation features, we can gain insight into not only when an individual is at a higher risk of lapsing, but why. To do so, I retrained the model using 1x daily EMA with geolocation and day level windows. High throughput computing was utilized along with the XGBOOST algorithm and 5 by 10 kfold cross validation. Using data from our alcohol use disorder sample, we can begin to understand the need for continuous monitoring to support recovery.

To start, lets characterize our sample. Data was collected on 151 individuals with moderate to severe AUD in the early stages of recovery. The majority of participants reported over 10 symptoms and committed to abstinence for the duration of the study.

![](aud_demographics.png)


:::{.notes}
We had reasonable diversity across many characteristics including age, sex at birth, marital status, education, and income. However, given the recruiting methods, there is very little racial and ethnic diversity in the sample. The sample is predominately white and non-Hispanic.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Area under ROC Curve (auROC)</span>

![](aud_auroc_v4.png) 

:::{.notes}
The best configuration resulted in a median auroc of .85. The histogram reveals the performance  across the 50 folds, with some performing as low as .4 and as high as .96. The drop in performance is likely due to using 24-hr periods instead of hour-by-hour windows to predict lapse probability. Despite the drop in performance, additional geolocation improved the models contextual awareness, a key step that brings us closer to deploying a real-time risk monitoring and support system.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Global Importance</span>


![](aud_global_importance.png) 


:::{.notes} 
Global importance reveals which risk features were the most important across participants. Past use and future efficacy were by far the most important predictors of lapse. These were derived from the daily EMA's, where participants reported drinking since their last assessment, and confidence in future recovery. In regards to the geolocation features, risky location was the most important. Others include: alcohol availability at location, type of location, and location valence. However, these risk factors impact lapse probability at different times, for different people. Lets look at how these features can predict lapse probability.

- [Shapley Values]{style="color: blue;"}

  -   **Negative** values **decrease** lapse risk probability.

  -   **Positive** values **increase** lapse risk probability.

:::{.notes}
SHAP values are an explanatory approach providing insight into the relative risk factors for an individual. This allows us to determine which features on which days impact lapse risk for each participant. Negative values indicate a decreased risk of lapse, while positive values represent an increased risk. Lets look at the most important features for a specific participant across the study.

![](aud_big_jump.png)

:::{.notes}
In the beginning, This participant had little change in their risk features, with past use and future efficacy bringing down their probability of lapse. The other features are staying constant at zero, indicating little to no influence on lapse risk. However, around day 35, past use, the blue line, drives up their lapse risk considerably. This increase coincides with the slight increase in time spent at a risky location, as shown with the purple line. This geolocation feature provides insights into why this individual may have lapsed. Moreover, future efficacy, the yellow-green line, jumps shortly after past use slightly decreases. There is an almost inverse relation between the two. This makes sense as a person who is currently using is likley to feel less confident about future abstinence. The variability of this plot highlights that At any given day, the most important feature impacting lapse risk can change. The ability to use these features to deliver tailored interventions that support recovery is the first step towards clinical implementation.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Future Directions</span>

- Measuring [trust]{style="color: blue;"}, [engagement]{style="color: blue;"}, and [usability]{style="color: blue;"} of risk-monitoring system interventions

\

- Determining how models can be [clinically useful]{style="color: blue;"} 

\

- Writing [recommendations]{style="color: blue;"} based on important features

:::{.notes}
Now that we know the most important features impacting lapse probability, we can begin to develop support recommendations for model implementation. Our team is actively exploring the optimal methods for delivering these recommendations, including the language, tone, and format, to minimize participant burden. We are working to develop reliable approaches that measure the system's trust, engagement, and usability. In doing so, we hope to see that engaging with support messages acts as a protective factor in recovery. Once the system is implemented, we will provide users with tailored recommendations based on their current risk features.
