:::{.notes}
Alcohol and Opioid use disorders are chronic, requiring lifelong management and continuous monitoring. In 2022, 48.7 million people aged 12 or older had a substance use disorder. Despite this, only about 1 in 4 who were classified as needing treatment actually received it. There are many barriers to accessing continued care in the United States, including affordability and availability. The stigmatization of substance use disorders creates an even bigger challenge for individuals to receive initial access to treatment.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Recovery is Dynamic</span>

- Important risk factors differ across people and time

\

- Need for continuous monitoring

\

- How can we provide the [right interventions]{style="color: blue;"} and [supports]{style="color: blue;"} to the [right people]{style="color: blue;"} at the [right time]{style="color: blue;"}, [every time?]{style="color: blue;"}

:::{.notes}
Recovery is dynamic in nature as important risk factors change across time both within and between individuals. That is, interventions that support early recovery might differ from what's needed later. For example, craving might be the most important factor in early recovery, requiring interventions like urge-surfing. Over-time, the importance of craving will likely decrease, given their engaging with the proper interventions. Later on, the same individual could experience a stressful event that requires a different intervention, like attending an AA meeting. Hence, the risk factors impacting recovery require continuous monitoring to deploy the necessary intervention, for that individual, at that particular moment in time.

\

:::{.notes}
Before I get any further, it is important to distinguish lapse from relapse. Lapses are clearly defined and have a temporally precise onset.They're an important target for intervention and serve as an early warning sign for relapse. A single lapse can be detrimental resulting in overdose and death.

Our aim is to implement a risk-monitoring system that can deliver real-time, tailored interventions, while mitigating barriers in accessibility. Machine learning algorithms and sensing methods provide the ability to deliver personalized support and recommendations within a stand-alone support system. Through NIAAA funding, the first steps towards developing this system were taken.

Lapse risk is monitored through both active and passive sensing methods. Ecological momentary assessments refer to daily self-report measures that assess mood, experiences, and past use. These allow the individual to reflect daily on the risk factors impacting their recovery. The calendar image shows where participants report whether or not they have drank alcohol since their last assessment. Through passive sensing methods, geolocation and cellular communication data was also collected. These methods were used over the course of three months with the aim of predicting lapse probability in individuals' recovering from alcohol use disorder.

We had reasonable diversity across many characteristics including age, sex at birth, marital status, education, and income. However, given the recruiting methods, there is very little racial and ethnic diversity in the sample. The sample is predominately white and non-Hispanic.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Predicting Lapse with EMA</span>

- Predict hour-by-hour probability of [future lapse]{style="color: blue;"}
  - Machine learning models

\

- Area under the ROC curve (auROC): [**0.91**]{style="color: blue;"}
    - 4x daily EMA 
    - XGBoost Algorithm

:::{.notes} 
 Using four time daily ema's, a machine learning model was trained using hour by hour windows to predict lapse probabilities. The model predicted next-day lapse with an area under the ROC curve of 0.91, far surpassing industry benchmarks. This means there is a 91% chance that the model will score a lapse higher than a no-lapse.
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">How do we implement for clinical benefit?</span>

- Retrain model with [geolocation]{style="color: blue;"} and [EMA]{style="color: blue;"}
  - Key step towards real-time risk-prediction system
  

- Geolocation & 1x daily EMA Model
  - XGBoost algorithm
  - 5x10 k-fold CV
  - Day level windows

:::{.notes}
Now that we can successfully predict lapse probability, how can we implement the model for clinical benefit? With the addition of geolocation features, we can gain insight into not only when an individual is at a higher risk of lapsing, but why. To do so, I retrained the model using 1x daily EMA with geolocation and day level windows. High throughput computing was utilized along with the XGBOOST algorithm and 5 by 10 kfold cross validation. The additional geolocation improved the models contextual awareness, a key step that brought us closer to deploying a real-time risk prediction system for clinical implementation.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Area under ROC Curve (auROC)</span>

![](aud_auroc_v4.png) 

:::{.notes}
The best configuration resulted in a median auroc of .85. The histogram reveals the performance  across the 50 folds, with some performing as low as .4 and as high as .96. The drop in performance is likely due to using 24-hr periods instead of hour-by-hour windows.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Global Importance</span>


![](aud_global_importance.png) 


:::{.notes} 
Global importance reveals which risk features were the most important across participants. Past use and future efficacy were by far the most important predictors of lapse. These were derived from the daily EMA's, where participants reported drinking since their last assessment, and confidence in future recovery. In regards to the geolocation features, risky location was the most important. Others include: alcohol availability at location, type of location, and location valence. However, different risk factors impact lapse probability at different times, for different people. 
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Local Importance</span>

- [Shapley Values]{style="color: blue;"}

  -   **Negative** values **decrease** lapse probability.
  
  \
  
  -   **Positive** values **increase** lapse probability.

:::{.notes}
SHAP values are an explanatory approach revealing which features on which days change lapse probability for each participant. Negative values decrease lapse probability, while positive values increase it. Lets look at the most important features for a specific participant across the study.
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Local Importance</span>


![](aud_shaps_48.png)

:::{.notes}

Starting from day 1, there is a large jump in future efficacy, as shown by the lime green line. Around day 5, there is a significant increase in past use, the blue line, as future efficacy plummets. The inverse relation between these two can be observed across time, as increases in past use seem to coincide with a decrease in future efficacy, and vice versa. As expected, lapsing caused a decrease in their confidence in recovery. The red line bringing downb their lapse probability is alcohol availability at location. 
:::

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Local Importance</span>


![](aud_big_drop.png)

:::{.notes}
Starting from day 1, this participants' report of past use drove up their lapse probability, as seen by the blue line The lime green line shows future efficacy, which is confidence in not drinking. There is almost an inverse relation between the two, as past use increases usually coincide with decreases in future efficacy. This makes sense because if someone is currently using, their confidence in abstaining would likely decrease. Around day 50, there is a noticeable drop in past use, bringing it down to baseline, or zero. Future efficacy dips below zero indicating this is decreasing that individuals risk of lapse. This graph shows how different risk factors were the most important on different days.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Local Importance</span>


![](aud_big_jump.png)

:::{.notes}
In the beginning, This participant had little change in their risk features, with past use and future efficacy bringing down their probability of lapse. The other features are staying constant at zero, indicating little to no influence on lapse risk. However, around day 35, past use, the blue line, drives up their lapse risk considerably. This increase coincides with the slight increase in time spent at a risky location, as shown with the purple line. This geolocation feature provides insights into why this individual may have lapsed. Moreover, future efficacy, the yellow-green line, jumps shortly after past use slightly decreases. There is an almost inverse relation between the two. This makes sense as a person who is currently using is likley to feel less confident about future abstinence. The variability of this plot highlights that At any given day, the most important feature impacting lapse risk can change. The ability to use these features to deliver tailored interventions that support recovery is the first step towards clinical implementation.

- Take the daily EMA data.

:::{.notes} 
The Opioid Use Disorder project is at an initial stage, with new data continuously being collected and further preprocessing tasks planned for the near future. At this stage, we present a preliminary model to provide an initial insight into the dataset. Using daily EMA data, we performed feature engineering to transform raw data into meaningful signals predictive of future opioid lapse, focusing on key variables such as pain, stress and happiness. Machine learning models were then developed to predict the likelihood of a lapse occurring on the following day.

The models were trained using the XGBoost algorithm with a five by ten-fold cross-validation. framework to ensure robust performance evaluation. Prior to training, unreliable responses were removed from the dataset, such as instances where participants reported lapses on a future date. Model training utilized high-throughput computing to efficiently explore and identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters. The final model achieved an outstanding AUROC of 0.94. Here is a graph of the roc curve for the best model, you can see that the line is very close to the top left corner, indicating excellent predictive performance.

:::{.notes}
Moving on to the monthly surveys. We are now at a stage to preprocess the data for model training. There can be a ceiling effect for participants' self-reported recovery because many participants reproted the highest value, meaning that those participants were all extremely satisfied with their recovery goals, extremely motivated to avoid using opioid for non-medical reasons and extremely confident in their ability to avoid using opioids for non-medical reasons. More work is needed to identify potential unreliable responses in the future.

## <span style="color: green; text-decoration: underline;">Future Directions</span>

- Measuring [trust]{style="color: blue;"}, [engagement]{style="color: blue;"}, and [usability]{style="color: blue;"} of risk-monitoring system interventions

\

- Determining how models can be [clinically useful]{style="color: blue;"} 

\

- Writing [recommendations]{style="color: blue;"} based on important features

:::{.notes}
For future directions, our group aim to develop reliable approaches in measuring trust, engagement, and usability of risk-monitoring system interventions. In addition, there are challenges in determining how models can be clinically useful. For example, when a participant shows low effectiveness, it is essential to determine whether the issue stems from limitations in the system itself or from the participant's low adherence to the system. 
Furthermore, once the system is implemented, we will provide users with recommendations based on the identified important features. Our team is actively exploring the optimal methods for delivering these recommendations, including the language, tone, and format, to minimize participant burden and maximize effectiveness.
